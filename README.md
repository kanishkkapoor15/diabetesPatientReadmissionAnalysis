# diabetesPatientReadmissionAnalysis

This study aimed to identify key predictors using R influencing hospital readmission among diabetic patients and analyze cost/resource allocation for effective healthcare management. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and machine learning techniques, we uncovered significant insights that can aid in optimizing patient care and hospital efficiency.

Key Findings:

 Predictors of Readmission:
	•	Logistic regression and t-tests confirmed that number of procedures, medications, diagnoses, lab tests, and hospital stay duration significantly impact readmission.
	•	Demographic factors (age, race, and gender) also showed statistical significance, highlighting disparities in healthcare outcomes.

 Clustering & Cost Analysis:
	•	Age groups provided a predefined segmentation, making traditional clustering methods like K-Means less effective.
	•	Instead, we conducted ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests to assess cost differences across age groups and medical features.
	•	Findings suggested that certain age groups and medical conditions contribute disproportionately to healthcare costs.

 Implications for Healthcare Resource Management:
	•	The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) emphasized the need for targeted interventions in high-risk groups to reduce readmission rates.
	•	Optimizing medication management and diagnostic procedures can potentially lower unnecessary hospitalizations and improve patient outcomes.
	•	Hospitals can use these insights to implement personalized treatment plans, reduce costs, and enhance patient care quality.
